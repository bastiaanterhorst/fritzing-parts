# My Fritzing parts
A small collection of Fritzing parts that I needed, but could not find online.
Note that this only contains breadboard and schematics views! The PCB view is *not* included as I do not need it.

### Usage
Download the files in the parts directory, and double click them to open in Fritzing. Off you go.

# Creating parts: workflow

- Build breadboard and schematic view in Vectornator
- Open resulting SVGs in a text editor and replace 100% width/height with actual dimensions in millimeters
- Create the part in Fritzing
